    faqs:
        faq1:
            headline: "Is the only difference the amount of pages, blog posts written, and A/B testing?"
            text: "Yes, that's correct! All of our packages include the same features, so you'll enjoy the same high-quality services regardless of the package you choose. The only distinction between the packages is the number of pages provided, blog posts written, and length of A/B Testing. Rest assured, you'll receive a top-notch website with all the essential features, regardless of the package you select."
        faq2:
            headline: "What happens if we part ways?"

            # However this does not apply to the “Starter” package. This is why we offer discounts on the other packages for long term users of the starter package. Your business won’t be a starter forever, and neither should be your website."
        # faq3: 
        #     headline: "Why is Starter $500 per month?"
        #     text: "The Starter package is priced at $500 per month to provide small businesses that are just starting out with an affordable way to access our comprehensive services. At our company, all service packages are typically paid upfront. However, we understand the unique needs and budget constraints of small businesses in their early stages. By offering the Starter package at a monthly payment structure, we aim to make our services more accessible and accommodating for these businesses. This allows them to benefit from our expertise, support, and comprehensive service while managing their financial resources effectively."
        faq4:
            headline: "What is A/B testing?"
            text: "A/B testing is like having your own secret weapon to supercharge your website's performance. Here's how it works: we create two different versions of a web page, and then we put them to the test. We show one version to a group of users (let's call it A), and another version to another group (we'll call it B). By closely monitoring how users interact with each version, we gather valuable insights on what grabs their attention, keeps them engaged, and ultimately drives them to take action.

            Think of it as a smart experiment where we carefully analyze the data to understand what resonates most with your audience. We use this knowledge to make informed tweaks and optimizations, ensuring your website is always on point and delivering the best results possible. In a nutshell, A/B testing helps us fine-tune your website to perfection, keeping you ahead of the game and giving you the edge you need to succeed online."
