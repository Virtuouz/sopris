## How I Got Here
Hey there, I'm Gio, a software engineer, and I've got a story to share with you. So, picture this – I was on the hunt for a reliable mechanic to fix up my trusty Chrysler 300c, a car that's over 15 years old. But as I started searching for mechanics in the Twin Falls area, I was shocked to discover that more than half of them didn't even have a website! Seriously, how was I supposed to know if they were any good or how to get in touch with them?

But then, amidst all the frustration, I stumbled upon a mechanic with fantastic reviews and an actual website – score! Excitedly, I clicked on the website link, only to find myself redirected to "Big Mechanic" (not the real name). Turns out, this local shop did have a website, but "Big Mechanic" had swooped in and snatched their domain name when it expired. Sneaky, right?

Despite the website mishap, I decided to give that mechanic a chance. And you know what? They provided outstanding service. Curiosity got the better of me, so I chatted with one of the employees and asked, "Hey, did you guys know your website link doesn't actually lead to your website?"

Their response caught me off guard. "Yeah, we know. Honestly, we just don't have the time or know-how to manage a website right now."

That got me thinking – was this website dilemma limited to the mechanic industry alone? So, when I got home, I went on a little Google adventure to investigate. I looked up mechanics, construction companies, electricians, plumbers, lawyers, even pet groomers – you name it. And guess what? It was the same story across the board. About half of the listed companies in every industry didn't have websites, and those that did often had outdated designs that did more harm than good.

Now, as a consumer, this irked me. I mean, how was I supposed to give my hard-earned money to a business when I knew next to nothing about them? It was a frustrating experience, to say the least.

So, I started wondering why more companies weren't partnering with website agencies. Curious, I reached out to a few local agencies for quotes. But their answers left me scratching my head. "Price depends on the project," they said. Fair enough, but when I provided more context, each agency gave me a different estimate. And the timeline? Oh boy, that ranged from two to six months!

I asked about their website creation process, and it seemed like there were endless meetings involved – design discussions, project kick-off meetings, preview sessions – the list went on. Putting my self in the shoes of a busy business owner, I couldn't fathom juggling multiple meetings for months on end. Plus, paying for a service and not getting a completed product for months? It just didn't sit right with me.

That's when it hit me – what if there was a company that offered consistent pricing, specialized in crafting business websites, delivered them faster, and created custom designs without relying on WordPress or its templates? So, like Thanos from the Avengers said, "Fine, I'll do it myself!"

I rolled up my sleeves and dedicated six months to mastering the art of building exceptional business websites from scratch – no website builders involved. And that's when Vynxlabs was born. Our mission? To solve all the problems I encountered along the way and provide hassle-free solutions to business owners like you.
