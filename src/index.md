At Sopris, our story is a tale of passion, family, and a dream brought to life. The name 'Sopris' is a fusion of my daughters' names, Sophie and Iris, symbolizing the heart and soul of our establishment.

With over a decade of experience managing restaurants, I embarked on a journey to create something truly special. Sopris is the realization of my dreamâ€”a place where I can do things my way and provide a unique culinary experience for our guests.

But Sopris is not just about where we are today; it's about where we're headed. We have big dreams for the future, including plans to expand and offer even more to our valued patrons. Our vision includes the addition of a buffet, where you can savor a diverse array of flavors and indulge to your heart's content.

At Sopris, we're not just serving meals; we're crafting memorable moments. Join us on this exciting journey, and together, we'll savor the present while embracing the limitless possibilities of the future.
