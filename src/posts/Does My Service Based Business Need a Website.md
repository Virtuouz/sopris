# Introduction
In todays world we are constantly connect to the internet, something that wasn't true just 20 years ago. Everyone relies on different digital platforms for their every day needs. Whether your need is to check the news or watch some entertaining short form content, their is a platform out there to satisfy your needs. Similarly, consumers have increasingly been searching for products and services online before they buy. 

For some industries, websites are almost mandatory and consumers expect as much. Examples of these types of industries are:
* E-commerce
* Hospitality
* Professional Services

The entire E-commerce industry is built around websites, its even implied in the name **E**-commerce! The hospitality industry is one that wasn't started because of websites, but adopted them to be practically mandatory. The most obvious examples would be hotels and resorts. Professional Services (businesses that provide a service to solve a problem) have been around as long as people have had problems needing to be solved. Industries that fall into the professional services category may have not started with websites, but nowadays customers looking for for a service expect these kind of businesses to have a website.

Not having a website for your business doesn't negatively impact, but it is also not capitalizing on all the positive impacts it would have. In other words, not having a website won't hurt your business, but you are not benefiting either. The biggest benefit a business without a website misses out on opportunities for customer acquisition.  Without a website, potential first time clients don't have an idea of what kind of business you are and if the business values align with theirs.

For the rest of this article we will focus most of our attention to professional Services

# Why to Have a Website
## 24/7 Marketing & Sales
The most clear benefit of having a website is that it becomes a 24/7 salesman that you don't have to pay and that conveys information to prospective clients without you need to be the one to give the information to them. You can't be awake 24 hours a day and be ready to answer customer questions the moment they call or email you. However, a website can do that and it is the one thing it does very well. 

## Competitive Advantage
With a website, you will receive and immediate competitive advantage over all the business in your industry that still don't have a website. People are less likely to buy a service from a business that doesn't have a website. This is because a website informs the potential buyer of how the service works. If your business doesn't have a website, they will go to a competitor who does to find answers to their questions. Your business can instead take advantage of this be and the one who is providing information instead of being the one who is overlooked.

## Organic Traffic
A website also helps you get more customers without needing to spend money on advertisement. With an SEO-optimized website, you increase your chances of showing up on front page of the google search results when someone is looking for your kind of service. If your website is showing up on the front page of search results, this gives you the opportunity to drastically increase your customer base.

## Saves You Time & Customer Service
Websites excel are providing a basic level of customer service without needing a person to be the one to answer their questions. A good website gives a prospective client all the information they should know about your service and it also answers the most common questions. This saves you time by not having to constantly explain what you do and by not having to answer the simple common questions. A positive consequence is that the callers you do get, are people who are seriously considering your service. This is because they most likely already checked out your website and decided you were the right person to solve their problem. 

## Build Trust and Credibility
A professional and well-designed website installs confidence in customers as it shows that your business is real, positions your business reliable, trustworthy, and established. As consumers, we expect every business to have a website, and when one doesn't we feel like the business might just be getting started because "what established business wouldn't have a website?"
### Testimonials
Having a website increases credibility compared to no website. Something that increases credibility even more is having testimonials of your customers directly on your website to showcase that you are in fact a real company offering the service that you say are, and its has actually solved the problem of others.


# Summary
Hopefully you now know the answer to the question "Do I need a website for my service based business?" If you don't I'll give you the answer, YES! A website does so much more than just provide information. It is your 24/7 marketer, salesman, support, and credibility establisher.
