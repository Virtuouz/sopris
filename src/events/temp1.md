# How it Works
At Sopris, our Eagles vs. Buccaneers Square Game is an exciting way to enjoy the game and possibly win big! Here's how it all works:

### **1. The Grid:** 
We'll have a physical grid with the x-axis representing one team's points and the y-axis representing the other team's points. It's a unique twist that makes watching the game even more engaging.

### **2. Predict the Scores:**
Before the game begins, you can purchase a square on the grid. Each square is determined by predicting the final score of both teams. Your predicted scores for each team will serve as coordinate pairs, marking your square on the grid.

### **3. Win Big:**
To win, your square must be within 1 square (either up, down, left, right, or diagonally) of the real final score when the game ends. If your square matches the score exactly or is within 1 square, congratulations – you're a winner!

### **4. The Prize:** 
The prize pool is created from the entry fees of participants. If there are no winners, the prize money rolls over to the next Square Game, making the pot even more tempting.

### **5. Entry Requirements:** 
To play the square game, simply purchase a meal with a value of $12 or more. It's a delicious way to get in on the action while enjoying a satisfying dining experience at Sopris.

So, come hungry, cheer for your team, and try your luck in our Eagles vs. Buccaneers Square Game. It's a fun and interactive way to enjoy the game while potentially scoring a tasty win!
